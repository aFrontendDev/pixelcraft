        My experience as a front end developer so far has mainly been working on large, content managed sites for very large, international companies. This has mainly been in the capacity of building new component libraries from the ground up, working closely with backend developers as well as designers and UX specialists.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in both agencies and in-house, for <a href="https://www.degree53.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external">Degree53</a>, <a href="https://building-blocks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external">Building Blocks (part of Dept)</a>, <a href="https://www.beautybay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external">Beauty Bay</a> in developer roles and also as lead front end developer whilst at Building Blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my time at Building Blocks I was fortunate enough to work on significant projects for some large brands including:
        <ul>
          <li>Adidas</li>
          <li>Universal Studios Orlando (including working onsite)</li>
          <li>United Airlines (onsite consultant)</li>
          <li>Butlins</li>
          <li>Many more...</li>
        </ul>
