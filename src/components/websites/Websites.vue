        If you require a new website built for your business, an existing website 'refreshed' or some new pages/components built for your website then I will be able to help in all of these things.

      <p>
        My fees for this kind of work will be entirely dependent on the size and scope of the work that's needed and can be negeotiated to suit us both. My experience prior to building large websites for multi-million dollar, international businesses was in making small sites for SMBs so I've plenty of experience to cover all needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual process for a small to medium business will be a couple of meetings prior to any work starting to gather your requirements, discuss potential design ideas and get a timeline for design, build and delivery. I will always be fleixble during the process to meet your needs and will respond to any changes that arise to fulfil your requirements.
