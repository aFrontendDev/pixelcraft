      <p>
        I provide my services as a front end developer to work for companies over a specified period on the agreed upon project at a day rate we can negotiate.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm happy to work on-site with your company providing it's in or around Manchester, alternatively I'm quite happy to work remotely and can join standups/meetings/etc via skype. I will also be available for a mixture of remote and on-site if we come to an agreement on a ratio that suits both parties. I generally try to be as flexible and accommodating as I can be.
